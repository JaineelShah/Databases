Difference between MySQL and PostgreSQL

1. Postgres is a feature-rich database that can handle complex queries and massive databases.

2. MySQL is simpler database thatâ€™s relatively easy to set up and manage, fast, reliable, and well-understood.

3. Postgres is an object-relational database (ORDBMS) with features like table inheritance and function overloading, where as MySQL is a pure 
relational database (RDBMS).

4. In postgress there is no support for NVARCHAR data type where as in MSSQL it supports. 
NVARCHAR basically stores each char as 2 bytes and can be used to store Unicode data.
